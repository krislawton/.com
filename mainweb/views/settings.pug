      h1 Your settings
      p On this page, you can configure yourself.
      h2 Display name
      p.smol
        | Your display name is your nickname. Whenever the site makes reference to you, 
        | it will usually use your display name. It doesn't have to be unique, and you 
        | can change it as often as you want.
      form.setting(name="displayName")
        label(for="displayName") Display name
        div.mid-col

        div.error(style="display: none")
      h2 User ID
      p.smol
        | Your user ID is your own custom unique identifier. It is displayed discretely 
        | (if the site makes reference to you, it will use your display name explicitly, 
        | but it might have a hovercard with your user ID in it). It should help people 
        | identify you if you're memeing about with your display name. Please don't
        | change your user ID too often.

      h2 Permanent ID
      p.smol
        | For technical reasons, you are assigned a fairly-random permanent ID number
        | on creating your account. You cannot change this number.
      div.indented
        p(style="width: auto") 
          | Your permanent ID is 
          span.yourPermaId

      h2 Password
      p.smol Remember: Your password is stored as plain text and your connection is not secure.
      form.setting(name="password")
        label(for="password") New password
        div.mid-col

      h2 Session management
      p.smol
        | With the session manager, you can see and manage all the devices/browsers you are logged in to. 
      p.smol.load-with-sm
        | Session ID is randomly generated. It's shown here because Kris likes to show off his arbitrary
        | creations.
      p.smol.load-with-sm
        | Used shows you the first time you used the session and the most recent use. This data was only 
        | tracked as of around April 26, 2018, whereas sessions and page loads have been tracked since
        | February. Henceforth, any sessions used only before April 26 will show as "Unknown", and 
        | sessions used since will show a start date of April 26, despite the fact that may not be their
        | first use.
      p.smol.load-with-sm
        | Page loads shows you how many page loads the session has done. 
      p.smol.load-with-sm
        | IPs shows you how many IP addresses have been used with that session. A number higher than 1 
        | here probably you've used this session on a mobile, or maybe it's just that your IP address has 
        | changed. IP addresses are stored in plaintext, so if you would like to know which IPs we have 
        | on record, please ask Kris.
      p.smol.load-with-sm
        | Please note, this site does not collect data on what browser or device you're using, so we
        | cannot show you that information.
